<!-- Content -->
Back in late July of 2020, I decided I wanted to begin doing commissions. It was quite nervewrecking to do, as I still had a lot of things I wanted to learn, and get more confident at doing, so doing commissions was a great opportunity for me to study art a bit more in depth, and improve!

Overall, opening up commissions for the first time during this year has taught me a lot of new things, like **new drawing skills**, how to **work with clients**, how to **manage my own freelance business** and how to **prepare, package and post artwork prints**.

In this blog, I will be showcasing the commissions which I have done (and have had permission to post) throughout the year, as well as talking and showcasing the process for some of these.

# Commissions Over The Months...
Commissions aren't something I began at the beginning of the year, I started my first commission at the end of July, making it just under 6 months of commission work for this year.

The good thing about this, is if I'm having a busy month, I don't have to take on as many clients, I'm my own boss, so I can work at my own rate!

## July - <span class="highlighted-text">1x Commission</span>
I got 1 commission in July, and this was from a friend. 
It was scary at first, but thanks to the success of this commission, I was confident enough to carry on with others.



<a name="august"></a>
## August - <span class="highlighted-text">16x Commissions</span>
This month is where things **really** kicked off, I made a few commission sheets, and then got a lot of responses from them! This month was crucial to learn about how to deal with a lot of clients at once

<a name="september"></a>
## September - <span class="highlighted-text">8x Commissions</span>
This is the month that I was starting my first year of University, I was using my Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 to draw, and travelling a lot back and forth between my home and University Accomodation to move my stuff, so considering how busy I was, I did quite a few commissions!

<a name="october"></a>
## October - <span class="highlighted-text">2x Commissions</span>
University caught up on me during October and November, as I was starting the course, there was lots of work assigned and new stuff to study! So, I didn't so as many commissions

<a name="november"></a>
## November - <span class="highlighted-text">2x Commissions</span>

<a name="december"></a>
## December - <span class="highlighted-text">8x Commissions</span>
During this month, I began offering and selling physical A3 and A4 prints of commissions, this was really exciting, and helped me learn about all things printing and posting!
