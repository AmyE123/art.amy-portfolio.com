<!-- Content -->
Back in late July of 2020, I decided I wanted to begin doing commissions. It was quite nervewrecking to do, as I still had a lot of things I wanted to learn, and get more confident at doing, so doing commissions was a great opportunity for me to study art a bit more in depth, and improve!

Overall, opening up commissions for the first time during this year has taught me a lot of new things, like **new drawing skills**, how to **work with clients**, how to **manage my own freelance business** and how to **prepare, package and post artwork prints**.

In this blog, I will be showcasing the commissions which I have done (and have had permission to post) throughout the year, as well as talking and showcasing the process for some of these.

# Intro 
## July
I got 1 commission in July, and this was from a friend. 
It was scary at first, but thanks to the success of this commission, I was confident enough to carry on with others.

# The Movies Project

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
